# Technical assessment
In this task, you should finalize the scenario. The user should enter "Rent Ready" into the search bar and click "Search" button.
The page objects you need here are buttonSearch and inputSearch. They are implemented in test-page-example. Pay attention to the fact that objects and their implementation should be used without quotes.

The project is created using https://github.com/Marketionist/testcafe-cucumber-steps. You can find more examples here.

The solution should contain:
1. The [test-example.feature](tests/test-example.feature) file with the complete scenario.
2. Link to a video recording where you demonstrate tests execution.
